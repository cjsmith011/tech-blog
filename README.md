#tech-blog
Thank you for checking out my Tech Blog project.

To build this project, I referenced 2 prior projects: the Just-Tech-News async module and also the class activities for Week 14.

There was so much code to build for this, I definitely learned much more about the file structure, mysql seeds, and the interconnection with the routes, models and seeds.  I still need much more time to learn how handlebars work.
